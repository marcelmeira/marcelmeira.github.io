            <p>
                I'm a character artist and illustrator focused on stylized visuals
                for games and animation.<br>
                With over 10 years of experience as a tattoo artist working with
                geek, anime and game-inspired designs, I've developed a
                strong foundation in applied art and visual storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past 3 years, I've been working with digital illustration
                and character design, building projects aimed at expressive,
                readable and production-ready designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use Photoshop and Procreate in my daily workflow and am
                currently available for remote and freelance opportunities.
